In this page, you can quickly scan through my latest published books 📚 and blog posts 📌. But, if you prefer, you can read a quick resume of me and my work in the [About Me](about.qmd) section too. Be free to contact me via email if you have an interesting proposal 😉. If you want to support me monetarily, you can send me a Pix (more info in the [Donate or Sponsor Me](donate.qmd) section).
