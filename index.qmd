In this page, you can quickly scan through my latest published books `r emoji::emoji("books")` and blog posts `r emoji::emoji("pushpin")`. But, if you prefer, you can read a quick resume of me and my work in the [About Me](about.qmd) section too. Be free to contact me via email if you have an interesting proposal `r emoji::emoji('winking_face')`.
