# Payment methods

Currently, I only support direct transfers made via [Pix](https://business.ebanx.com/en/resources/payments-explained/pix-instant-payment-system). Which is a brazilian payment method available in most banks operating in the Brazilian market.

```{js, echo = FALSE}
function copyText() {
    navigator.clipboard.writeText(
      "00020101021126580014br.gov.bcb.pix01362510f316-d7d3-4282-8c93-6f9ca1d203b75204000053039865802BR5918PEDRO DUARTE FARIA6013BELO HORIZONT62070503***630446EB"
    );
    alert("Copied Pix key to your clipboard!")
}
```

# Copy and paste it

You can click in the button to copy my Pix key to your clipboard:

<button type="button" class="btn btn-primary" onclick="copyText()">Copy Pix Key</button>

# Scan a QR Code

Or, if you prefer, you can get my Pix key with this QR Code:

```{r, out.width="50%", fig.align='center', echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("files/images/pix-qrcode.jpg")
```
