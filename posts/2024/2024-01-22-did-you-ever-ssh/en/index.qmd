# How SSH works?

SSH stands for *Secure Socket Shell*, and it is probably the most used protocol today
to establish a secure connection between two computers.


# Find the IP Address of your Server

If you are on Windows,
and look for the IPv4 address in this window:

![Looking the IP Address in Windows](./../windows-ip.png)

If you are on Linux, then, you can open a terminal, and
run the command `ifconfig`, then look for the IPv4 address
that will appear after the `inet` word.

```bash
ifconfig
```

# Find the users available in your server

```bash
cut -d: -f1 /etc/passwd
```



```bash
ssh user@ip_address
```

```bash
ssh-keygen
```

```bash
ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa pedro@171.0.0.1
```
