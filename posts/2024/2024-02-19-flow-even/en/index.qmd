# Introduction

I'm currently writing a book about a specific intersection between R and Graphics (stay tuned for more news about this book soon ðŸ˜‰).
During my research for this book, I had to study a relatively famous and established algorithm, called as the Jobard-Lefer algorithm.
It is an algorithm for producing evenly spaced curves in a flow field (or a vector field if you prefer).

This algorithm is thoroughly described in a scientific paper [@jobard97].
