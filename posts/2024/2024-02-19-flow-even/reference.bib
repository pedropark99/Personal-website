abstract="This paper presents a new evenly-spaced streamlines placement algorithm to visualize 2D steady flows. The main technical contribution of this work is to propose a single method to compute a wide variety of flow field images, ranging from texture-like to hand-drawing styles. Indeed the control of the density of the field is very easy since the user only needs to set the separating distance between adjacent streamlines, which is related to the overall density of the image. We show that our method produces images of a quality at least as good as other methods but that it is computationally less expensive and offers a better control on the rendering process.",
