## Introduction

I'm very happy to announce the realease of `figma` R package to CRAN! This package provides a R interface (you can call it a "wrapper" too if you prefer) to the Figma API. Below we have all the important links about this package:

{{< include ../buttons-en.html >}}

This is the first release (or the first version) of the package, and for now, it have all the necessary functionality to get all data from a Figma file (through the `/files/` endpoint), and bring it to your R session. But in the future, the package will include more functionalities and endpoints. Please, if you can, test this package and give feedbacks or report bugs by [sending Issues on the official repository](https://github.com/pedropark99/figma/issues).


## Getting started

Fist of all, you need to install the package on your machine. And to do that, you can use this code:

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("figma")
```
