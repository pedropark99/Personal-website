# Introduction

Last week, me and my team encountered a situation where we need to find out why and how
a certain problem occurred. We needed to understand which decisions led
to this problem, and why they were made. Pretty normal stuff right?

But understanding what happened was only possible for us because we track every change and every decision that we make with Git,
by signing commits and writing Pull Requests (or PRs for short). This article uses this real world situation that we faced
to showcase how Git and formal processes to register changes in the codebase (like PRs) are a critical part for
improving decision making and understanding how your past decisions are affecting you in the present.

I begin the article describing what problem occurred, and in sequence, I explain what mistakes were made, and how Git helped
us to identify those mistakes.

# The data pipeline where the problem occurred

The problem occurred in one of the many data pipelines[^what-is-pipelines] that we manage and support.
This specific data pipeline was a "aggregate the data and send the results to client" type of pipeline.
In more technical details, this pipeline was a JSON file that cointained all metadata that described what this pipeline was,
what steps it performed, what were the dependencies and settings for each task, which specific time of the day these tasks
should be performed, etc.

[^what-is-pipelines]: What is a pipeline? A pipeline is just a sequence of steps (or tasks)
to be performed at a specific time of the day (or a specific day of the week or of the month, etc.).
And a data pipeline is a pipeline that contains tasks that load, transform, send, or ingest data in some form.



The main step (or task) performed in this pipeline
was triggering the execution of a Python notebook. This notebook was perfoming the following steps:


1. aggregates the raw data to get the total sales made per channel.
2. saves the result in a CSV or Excel file.
3. send this CSV or Excel file by email to the client.

The following diagram show these steps in a visual manner:

# What problem occurred ?

Our client notified us saying that they were not receiving the CSV files for about a week.
So we started to search for this data pipeline, to look at it's execution logs.
But we did not find anything! Both the Python notebook and the JSON file that described the data pipeline itself disappeared!
Is like they never existed.


Not having the Python notebook, is the same as not having any pipeline at all. Both Python and JSON files had simply disapeared from our repository.
But the client did received some files a few weeks ago, so,
we were positive that this pipeline did existed at some point in the past. But where did it go? Why it disappeared?


# Investigating the commmits

We use Git to store and track any changes in all of our data pipelines. In other words,
all changes that we make to the JSON files that describes each one of our data pipelines are tracked by Git.
As you well know, a file do not simply disappear from a Git repository. When a file is removed from a Git repository, 
is because someone intentionally deleted the file and committed the change to the repository.

Since we knew that this data pipeline existed at some point in the time, I started to investigate,
and follow the history of commits. Took around 30 minutes to find the exact commit that deleted the
data pipeline, and, oops! The commit was created by me! I deleted the data pipeline from our
repository. Ok... now Why? Why did I deleted this data pipeline?

At this point, Git already helped me to answer
two very important questions which were: 1. Who deleted the pipeline? 2. When it was deleted?
Because every commit you create in Git have a timestamp associated with it, and the name of the author of
that commit, we knew at that point that it was me that deleted the pipeline, a few weeks ago.



# Why I made this decision?

But that alone does not answers another part of the problem. We still need to know why I made that decision.
Why did I intentionally deleted this pipeline? This is the point where Pull Requests[^what-are-prs] can help us.



[^what-are-prs]: In essence, a Pull Request (or PR) is a **proposal** to perform a `git merge` operation. 
In other words, you create a PR when you want to merge the changes you made in a branch into another branch
(most of the times the main branch). The "proposal" aspect of a PR means that it needs be approved to be effectively performed.
A PR is not a feature from
Git. It is actually a standard feature from most Git service providers. So you create a PR inside a Git services platform such as GitHub,
GitLab and Azure DevOps, and not inside Git itself.
If you are not familiar with PRs, the
[GitHub documentation has an excellent article about it](<https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/proposing-changes-to-your-work-with-pull-requests/about-pull-requests>)


Every time we want to publish some changes that we made to a data pipeline, we need to document these changes in a PR.
We describe what changes we made, and why we made them. I found the associated PR that contained the commit I made,
and in the description of that PR I found the reason why I deleted the pipeline.

The pipeline was constantly failing with a "notebook not found" error. In other words, the pipeline was trying to trigger
the execution of the Python notebook that I mentioned before. But the notebook itself was not found, and
because of that, it was throwing this error. This means that the pipeline was basically
useless, it was creating execution costs without delivering any value. It also means,
that the Python notebook disappeared before the pipeline was deleted.

So I deleted the pipeline. This way we were not spending our resources trying to execute something that we know is going
to throw an error, and will not give any value.



# Another part of the problem

Ok, now we know why I deleted the pipeline. But that in itself raises some new questions for us.
Why did the Python notebook disappeared?


# What mistakes were made?




# How Git helped us to solve the issue


So we needed to find who deleted the data pipeline, why this person made this decision, and when the deletion
was made. Thanks to the our Git history of commits, we just follow the trails of commits and we found the exact
commit that deleted the pipeline, and understand how our previous actions triggered the current problem.


Me and my team perform many decisions all the time that affect the maintained pipelines.
As a consequence, when you make so many decisions and changes to the codebase like this, is really hard to remember what decision you made, when and
why you made it, etc. That is why Git help us so much, because it tracks all of these changes for us.



Because of Git, we manage to track down and understand how and why did this data pipeline disappeared, and
we were able to locate the data pipeline again, and restore it to it's previous state,
and re-send the files.

Not only did we fixed the issue, but also, by understanding what happened, and what decisions were made
that led to the dissapeareance of the data pipeline, we could identify the flaws in our decision making process.
And by identifying these issues, we can now address them, so we do not make these mistakes again.

Over the next sections, I explain what happened, what mistakes were made, and how we could have avoided this problem.
