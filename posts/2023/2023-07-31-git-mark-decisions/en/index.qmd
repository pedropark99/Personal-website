# Introduction

In the last week, me and my team encountered a situation where we need to find out why and how
a certain problem occurred. We needed to understand which decisions led
to this problem, and how they were made. Pretty normal stuff right?

But understanding what did happened was only possible for us because we do track every change and decision that we make with Git,
by signing commits and writing Pull Requests (or PRs for short). This article uses this real world situation that we faced
to showcase how Git and formal processes to register changes in the codebase (like PRs) are a critical part for
improving decision making and understanding how your past decisions are affecting you in the present.



# Context about the problem that we needed to understand



# How Git solved

However, this problem was not so simple for a team of only 2 peoples that makes every
week ~50 commits, and do maintanance of 800 data pipelines,
and works with ~30 cards from technical support. When you make 
so many changes, or, in other words, when you make so many decisions per week like
this, is really hard to remember what happened on the week before, or even yesterday.
