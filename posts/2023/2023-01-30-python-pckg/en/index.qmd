# Introduction

In 2022, I developed my first Python package called [`spark_map`](https://github.com/pedropark99/spark_map), and published it at PyPI. If you want to know more about this package üòâ, you can check [a previous post here](https://pedro-faria.netlify.app/posts/2022/2022-12-21-spark-map-v0.2.3/en/), where I introduced the package, and described it's main features, and showed a small use case.

Now, although `spark_map` is a small Python package, I had a hard time developing it. More specifically, the Python code was not hard at all to develop. But packaging it into a proper package üì¶ was hard. In this post, I want to share a few things that I learned about Python package development in this process.

# Before I say anything, some references

The development of this package involved reading several articles üìì, and doing some practical tests üß™. Here I share some of the best resources I discovered along the way.

First, a great article to start your project is the [Packaging Python Projects](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/tutorials/packaging-projects/) tutorial. This tutorial is written by PyPA, or, the [Python Packaging Authority](https://www.pypa.io/en/latest/) team[^foot1], and it seems to be "The Place" to search for best practices on Python package projects.

[^foot1]: Probably a bad name for a team. But, that is just my opinion.

The PyPA team also have a very detailed documentation about [Packaging and distributing projects](https://packaging.python.org/en/latest/guides/distributing-packages-using-setuptools/) with `setuptools`. This is a more technical, detailed documentation, but, it can be a great resource too.

Another very useful article to learn about the structure of a Python package, and the import process of Python, is the article entitled [Dead Simple Python: Project Structure and Imports](https://dev.to/codemouse92/dead-simple-python-project-structure-and-imports-38c6) from Jason C. McDonald.

# Now, let's dive in

## The search path of Python

We usually import a package in Python, by including a `import` statement at the beginning of our script. For example, to import the `pandas` package to my Python session, I could do this:

```{python}
import pandas
```

When you import a package in Python, the Python interpreter starts a search process üîç through your computer, to find the specific package you called in your script. Every Python package you use must be installed in your machine. Otherwise, Python will never find it, and, as a consequence, you can not use it. 

The Python interpreter will always look for the packages you import, inside a set of pre-defined locations of your computer. This pre-defined list is stored inside the `sys.path` variable [@pymodule]. In other words, when you import a package, Python looks for this package inside each one of the directories listed at `sys.path` variable. 

```{python}
import sys
print(sys.path)
```

You might also find contents about the `PYTHONPATH` variable when searching for this subject on the internet. In essence, `PYTHONPATH` is a environment variable that can contain a complementary list of directories to be added to `sys.path` [@pypathvar].

As you can imagine, the Python interpreter look into these directories in a sequential manner. That is, Python looks for the package at the first folder. If it does not find the package you called, then, it looks at the second folder. If it does not find the package again, it looks at the third folder. And goes on and on, until it hits the last folder of the list.

If does not find the package you called at this last folder, Python will automatically raise a `ModuleNotFoundError` error. As you expect, this error means that Python could not find the package you called at any of the directories listed at `sys.path`.

## Do not change the `sys.path` or `PYTHONPATH` variable ‚ö†Ô∏è

The `sys.path` variable is a standard Python list, and, as any other list, can be altered to include other directories that are not currently there. The same goes for the `PYTHONPATH` variable, which is an environment variable, and can be altered too. 

As an example, when you try to import your package, which is stored at folder `A`, and, you face a `ModuleNotFoundError` error, you might be tempted to alter `PYTHONPATH` or `sys.path`, to add the folder `A` to this search path of Python. DO NOT DO IT! YOU SHOULD NEVER alter `PYTHONPATH` or `sys.path` ‚ö†Ô∏è ! I mean, at least not inside a Python package.

In other words, if at some point inside the source code of your Python package, you execute a code like this:

```{python}
#| eval: false
import sys
sys.path.append('./../weird-unknow-folder')
```

just erase this code! Python packages are made to be used by other peoples, and with a code like this above, you will change the search path of this user. Changing the search path of a user is a bad idea. Because you can accidentaly produce bad and confusing side effects to the user's session, which can be hard to debug and solve.

Besides, in the majority of times when you alter the `sys.path`, you are trying to overcome a bad structure of your files. In other words, you can always avoid altering the `sys.path` variable by changing the structure of your source files inside your project.

Just to be clear, is a bad idea to alter the `sys.path` inside the source code of your package. However, it is ok to alter these variables outside of your package.

As a practical example, Apache Spark is written in Scala. But it have a Python API available through the `pyspark` package. If you look closely into the source code of the project, or, more specifically at the [`run-tests.py`](https://github.com/apache/spark/blob/master/python/run-tests.py) file, you can see that new paths (or new directories) are appended to `sys.path` in this file.

However, this `run-tests.py` file IS NOT A PART of the `pyspark` package itself. It is just an auxiliary script (outside of the package) used to support the testing processes of `pyspark`. This means that `run-tests.py` contains code that is not intended to be executed by the users of the package, but by the developers of `pyspark` instead.


## Differences between a package and a module

This is a very basic knowledge for a Python developer. However, until recently, I did not know the meaning of these two concepts. So, I will give it to you now, in case you do not have it yet.

A Python module is a single Python file (i.e. a file with extension `.py`). Every Python script you write, is a Python module. In contrast, a Python package is a set of Python modules gathered together inside a folder. This folder must contain a particular Python module named as `__init__.py`. This `__init__.py` is the file that "initialize", or, "identifies" this folder as a Python package [@pypackages].

You can have multiple Python packages inside a Python package. That is, inside the directory of your package, you can have multiple sub-directories with more Python modules and `__init__.py` files. In this case, these sub-directories become submodules of the package. You can interpret them as sub-packages, if you prefer.


## Structuring the package was one of the hardest parts

Every Python package follows the same basic file/directory structure üèõÔ∏è. In other words, the files that compose a Python package are always structured in a standard way. But, understanding and using this structure effectively was one of the hardest parts for me. At this section, I want to explain this structure for you.

In a Python package project, you usually have these **files**:

- `LICENSE.md` or `LICENSE.rst` (or both): a text file with the license of your package. It can be a Markdown file (`.md`), or, a reStructuredText markup file (`.rst`);
- `README.md`: a Markdown file introducing your package. That is, a file that describes succintly the objective of the package, its main features, and showing a small example of use of the package;

- `setup.py` or `pyproject.toml` or `setup.cfg`: these are files used by the build system you choose to build (or compile) your Python package into a compact and shareable format;

Also, a Python package project usually contains these **folders (or directories)**:

- `src/<package-name>/` or `<package-name>/`: inside this directory you store all Python modules of your package, that is, the source code of your package;
- `tests/`: inside this directory you store all unit tests of your package. In other words, the scripts and automated workflow used to test your package.

<!--
- `doc/` or `docs/`: inside this directory you store all documentation files. That is, files that document your package, describe its contents, functionality and concepts;
-->

You must store the source code (or the python modules) of your package inside a folder with the same name as the package itself (i.e. the `<package-name>/` folder). So, for a package named `spark_map` we should keep the source files (i.e. the `.py` files) of this package inside a folder called `spark_map`. As a practical example, if you [look at the source code](https://github.com/pandas-dev/pandas/tree/main/pandas) of the famous `pandas` package, you will see that all source code of the package is stored inside a folder called `pandas`.

In contrast, this `<package-name>/` folder might be (or might be not) inside another folder called `src/`, that is, the path to the source code might be `src/<package-name>/` instead of `<package-name>/`. The `pandas` package for example, do not uses the `src/` folder, so the source code is stored inside the `pandas/` folder. In contrast, the famous `flask` package uses the `flask/` folder inside a `src/` folder, so the path to the source code becomes `src/flask`. [You can check this by looking at the source code of the package.](https://github.com/pallets/flask/tree/main/src/flask).

So the folder structure to store the source code of the package might change very slightly from package to package. There is no consensus about which one of these two structures is the best. But in general, the source is always stored inside a folder with the same name as the package (i.e. the `<package-name>/` folder). And this folder might be stored inside a `src/` folder.

Furthermore, every project of a Python package usually have one, two, or more files that **control the build process of the package** (like `setup.py`, `pyproject.toml` or `setup.cfg`). In other words, these files are not part of the package itself. But they are used by the **build system** to build (or compile) your package into a compact and shareable format. I talk more about these files at @sec-build-systems.

Having in mind all these files that we described until here, we can build a example of file structure for a package. For example, a possible file strucuture for a package named `haven` could be:

```
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ LICENSE.rst
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ pyproject.toml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ src
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ haven

‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ functions.py
‚îÇ       ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils.py 
‚îÇ       ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ haven.py
‚îÇ
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ tests
    ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ test_functions.py
    ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ test_haven.py
```



## Introducing build systems {#sec-build-systems}

When you are developing a package, you write multiple Python modules that perform all necessary tasks to solve the specific problem you want to solve with your package. However, in order to distribute this package to other peoples, that is, to make it available to the wide public, you need to compile (or build) your package into a compact and shareable format.

This is what a build system does. It compiles all archives of your package into a single and compact file that you can publish at PyPI, and distribute to other peoples. This means that, when a user downloads your package (through `pip` for example), it downloads this compact and shareable version of your package.

On the day of writing this article, there are four main build systems available on the market for Python packages, which are `hatchling`, `setuptools`, `flit` and `PDM`. No matter which one you use, just choose one, anyone. Because they do the same thing, and work in a very similar way.

Most of them use various metadata stored at the `pyproject.toml` file to build your project. The `setuptools` build system is probably a exception to this rule, because this build system supports other kinds of files to store this metadata, which are `setup.py` and `setup.cfg`.


### The `pyproject.toml` file as the commom ground

The [PEP517](https://peps.python.org/pep-0517/) and [PEP518](https://peps.python.org/pep-0518/) were lauched to stablish the `pyproject.toml` file as the commom ground to every build system. Basically, the `pyproject.toml` is a file included at the root level of your project, and contains metadata about your package (e.g. it's name, version, license, description, author, dependencies, etc.).

It represents a "commom ground" because all build systems available can read and use this file to build (or compile) your package. As a consequence, with this file, you can change very easily the build system you use in your package, without having to change various configurantions and files. All you have to do is to change the options under the `build-system` table.

This `build-system` table is the part of `pyproject.toml` file where you can specify options and configurations for the build system. As an example, to use the `setuptools` build system, you would add these lines to `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["setuptools"]
build-backend = "setuptools.build_meta"
```

In the other hand, if you want to use the `hatchling` build system instead, you would change the above lines to:

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["hatchling"]
build-backend = "hatchling.build"
```

Or, maybe you prefer `flit`:

```toml
[build-system]
requires = ["flit_core"]
build-backend = "flit_core.buildapi"
```

Anyway, you get it. You use the options `requires` and `build-backend` under the `build-system` table to specificy which system you want to use in the building process of your package. All of these different systems will use `pyproject.toml` to collect other very important metadata about your package, like these metadata below:

```toml
[project]
name = "spark_map"
version = "0.2.77"
authors = [
  { name="Pedro Faria", email="pedropark99@gmail.com" }
]
description = "Pyspark implementation of `map()` function for spark DataFrames"
readme = "README.md"
requires-python = ">=3.7"
license = { file = "LICENSE.txt" }
classifiers = [
    "Programming Language :: Python :: 3",
    "License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License",
    "Operating System :: OS Independent",
]

dependencies = [
    "pyspark",
    "setuptools",
    "toml"
]
```



### The `setuptools` build system

The `setuptools` build system is the system that I use to build `spark_map`. It is kind of a more "versatile"^[And I mean these quotation marks, because I am not sure to call a system which can be out of the standard as "being more versatile", or not.] system than the others, only because it supports other kinds of files besides `pyproject.toml`.

The `setup.py` file is probably the most "famous" file, or, the most associable to `setuptools`. Although this is changing in recent years (more about this at the next section), the `setup.py` is still considered the traditional way of using the system, as the documentation itself says:

> The traditional `setuptools` way of packaging Python modules uses a `setup()` function within the `setup.py` script. [@setuptools]

In summary, you can replace `pyproject.toml` with the `setup.py` file. Just as an example, I could replace the `pyproject.toml` file for `spark_map` with a `setup.py` file similar to the file below. The whole `setup.py` file is usually composed of just a single call to the `setuptools.setup()` function, and nothing more. All of the various metadata about the package stored at `pyproject.toml` are translated to named arguments to this `setup()` function.

```{python}
#| eval: false
# setup.py placed at root directory
from setuptools import setup
setup(
    name = 'spark_map'
    version = '0.2.77',
    author = 'Pedro Faria',
    description = 'Pyspark implementation of `map()` function for spark DataFrames',
    long_description = 'README.md',
    license = { file = "LICENSE.txt" }
    classifiers = [
        "Programming Language :: Python :: 3",
        "License :: OSI Approved :: MIT License",
        "Operating System :: OS Independent",
    ],
    python_requires = '>=3.7',
    install_requires = ['pyspark'],
    extras_require = ['setuptools', 'toml']
)
```

However, if you use a `setup.py` file you become kind of locked into the `setuptools` framework. This one the reasons why many developers prefer to use the `pyproject.toml` file instead. Because it becomes so much more easy to change between build systems if you want to.

Another "clash point" about the `setup.py` file is that it changes the way, or the steps (or the worflow) to build the package. The standard or the most supported strategy to build a package, is to use the `build` module command of Python at the terminal. This command will build your package, no matter which build system you use:

```bash
# If you are on Windows:
py -m build
# If you are on Linux:
python3 -m build
```

In contrast, when you use the `setup.py` file, you have to execute directly the script with some additional options, like `sdist`:

```bash
# If you are on Windows:
py setup.py sdist
# If you are on Linux:
python3 setup.py sdist
```

Again, this is bad, because it forces you into a certain framework, or, a certain workflow that is different than the standard way of building a package. 

### Avoid `setup.py` and use `pyproject.toml` instead

The Python community understood this problem, and now, executing the `setup.py` script directly is heavily discouraged [@ganssle]. Actually, the `setuptools` project itself started a movement to migrate it's functionality to `pyproject.toml` and `setup.cfg` files.

This concern is clearly documented at [the "Quick Start" section](https://setuptools.pypa.io/en/latest/userguide/quickstart.html#basic-use) of the official documentation for the project:

> Setuptools offers first class support for `setup.py` files as a configuration mechanism ... It is important to remember, however, that running this file as a script (e.g. `python setup.py sdist`) is strongly discouraged, and that the majority of the command line interfaces **are (or will be) deprecated** (e.g. `python setup.py install`, `python setup.py bdist_wininst`, ...) ... We also recommend users to expose as much as possible configuration in a more declarative way via the `pyproject.toml` or `setup.cfg`, and keep the `setup.py` minimal with only the dynamic parts (**or even omit it completely if applicable**).

In resume, avoid using `setup.py` in your project, and use `pyproject.toml` instead with the `python -m build` command. This a much more recommended workflow for building your package.

# Conclusion

In this article, I intended to share what I learned trough my journey of building my first Python package. In summary, the main subjects discussed here were:


- Do not change the `sys.path` or `PYTHONPATH` variable inside your package ‚ö†Ô∏è;

- Differences between a package and a module;

- Nailing the structure üèõÔ∏è of your package can be one the hardest parts;

- If you use `setuptools` to build your package, avoid `setup.py` and use `pyproject.toml` instead;

I hope this content help you to develop your projects. See you later üòâ !
