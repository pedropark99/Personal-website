In mathematics, a subscript is typically used to specify the base. For example, the decimal value 25,125 would be expressed in hexadecimal as 622516. In programming, a number of notations are used to denote hexadecimal numbers, usually involving a prefix. The prefix 0x is used in C, which would denote this value as 0x6225.
