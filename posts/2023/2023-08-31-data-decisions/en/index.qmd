# Introduction

This article describes a real-world situation where me and my team used data
to convince our client (which is one of the biggest companines in the brazilian
financial market) at the time to make a better decision. Special thanks to
[Guilherme Goes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guilhermeggarcia/) and [Paulo Gon√ßalves](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulo-gon-oli/). They both help me to present these ideas and insights to our client.

**Making decisions is hard**. But you always make a better decision when you have data
to guide you into a safer and better outcome. When you do not have data to back you up,
you are basically in the dark. That is, you make the decision, but you do not know
upfront what are the possible outcomes of that decision. You just hope for the best,
and this is always a hard position to be in.


## A Data Analyst should focus on understanding the business

You will probably notice that a big part of this article is dedicated
to give context and explain the business behind this example.

This is intentional! Because, one of the real values of this article is
to show that we come up with a good proposal to our client, because we
understood his business, and we raised some good hypothesis about this business,
and by analyzing these hypothesis we come up with a good new strategy.

If you do not understand the business you are analyzing, is less
likely that you will come up with a good strategy, or, a good
data analysis. By having a good understanding of the business,
you will likely have much better ideas on "how" to analyze the data you have.


# Context

In essence, our client was a big brazilian bank, one of the largest in the market.
The bank was using our digital plataform to sell different products and services through
[WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/). Our job was to analyze the data generated by the
platform to understand how the bank could increase their sales inside this channel.

## The secured loan product

A secured loan was one of several products offered by the bank on WhatsApp.
To acquire this product, the user needed to answer several questions, and also,
fit into some criterias.

Depending on the type of industry you work in, you might call this as the *sales flow*,
or, the *sales path*, which is the path (or the steps) that the user needs
to follow to acquire the product you are selling.

Most companies want to make this path as short as possible so that the user
gets to the product faster. However, we are talking about a loan,
so the bank certainly needs a lot of personal and financial information about the user
before it gives the loan.

So in this example, the user needed to answer a considerable amount
of questions through WhatsApp to get to the final step of the sales path, that is,
to confirm the loan.

Most of these questions were asking for some personal information, specially the social ID.
With the social ID at hand, we used some APIs to check whether this particular user
fitted or not into some important criterias. Most of these criterias
were very standard for any type of loan, like... the person should not have any legal debts
with the government.
Some other criterias were purelly financial and assets related,
and were also a very commom practice among banks, like...
the person needs to be fully employed, he/she needs to have a car which is
fully paid, and, this car needs to be a personal property of the person, i.e. it cannot be 
a borrowed car from another person.



## The weird criteria

But one of the many criterias was a bit strange for us. Identify the exact criteria is not important for the content of this article. Let's just say that, to be elegible for this loan, **the user needed to be elegible to three different modalities**.

Each modality corresponded to a different type of loan.
If the user was not elegible to all of these three modalities, or,
these three different types of loan,
we automatically rejected the user's request for the loan.

In essence, we had a flow that worked a bit like this:

![A small representation of the sales path](./../flow-extended.png)

Every time a user entered our flow, we collected the social ID of this user.
Because with this social ID we can use the API to check multiple informations
about this person. One of the many things we checked, was whether or not
this user was elegible to these three modalities.

## Why this was weird?

This was a weird criteria, because... if a user called "Ana" is elegible to modality A,
then, why not offer a loan of modality A to "Ana" ? If a user "Mike" is elegible
both to modalities A and B, then, we should offer both modalities (A and B) to him.
Let him get whatever loan he wants, right?

Why only users that are elegible to all
three modalities (A, B and C) get to decide which loan they want to get?
In our head, this criteria did not made much sense, because if an user
is elegible to one modality of loan, he should be able to get
a loan on this modality he is elegible to.


## Why this criteria existed?

This criteria existed either because a MVP strategy or a "risk trade-off" strategy.
The MVP strategy means that the bank included this weird criteria because it
greatly simplified the development of the sales path. By simplifying the
development, the bank could deliver a MVP (minimal viable product)
as fast as possible.

On the other side, the "risk trade-off" means that
the bank included this weird criteria, because it probably estimated
that the risk is considerably higher for people that are not
elegible to all three modalities. If the estimated risk is higher, then,
the bank have a good reason to not offer this loan to people
that are elegible to only one or two modalities.

Banks are constantly facing a trade-off between risk and profit. In
other words, a secured loan like this is always a good profit opportunity.
However, this profit opportunity always come at a cost, mostly in the form of risk.

That is why banks are usually very good at analysing and estimating risks. When a person
looks to acquire a loan, the bank starts to analyze several factors
in order to estimate how much risky is to give a loan to this person.



# What we discovered

We had the hypothesis that this business rule (about the three modalities)
was severely affecting the sales result. But we needed to confirm this hypothesis.

Since we had the data returned from the API, we could potentially identify
which users did have the three modalities, and which did not have. So we used R to collect the data
from the API, and to analyze this data to investigate the users metadata,
and potentially measure the size of the hole
that these users were creating.

As a result, we discovered that the bank was constantly losing a huge opportunity because of this
specific criteria, or, this specific business rule.
Doing some basic math, we identified that
**67% of the users that visited our channel were not elegible to all three modalities**.
This means that 67% of the users that entered our channel were automatically rejected.
We were constantly losing a huge chunk of potential leads
because they did not fitted into this criteria.

So, for example, if 13,000 users entered our channel, only $(1 - 0.67) \times 13,000 = 4,290$
of these users could potentially finish the path and acquire the loan. The
remaining 8,710 users were automatically lost. They were just rejected
because they did not had these three modalities.

This discovery generated some important possibilities for us:

- Are we reaching the right audience?
- Maybe we should focus in attract only people that do have the three modalities to our channel? 
- Is this criteria or business-rule worth it?




## Using data to get a better outcome

Our job was to use the data we collected, to show the bank that the potential gains of
selling different types of loans to these users that did not had the three modalities,
were much higher than the potential risk they offered. By using data, we can show the bank (in
numbers) the size of the opportunity they were losing. And that is exactly what we did.

Our argument was divided into two separate parts:

1. The size of the lost;
1. The size of the potential gain;

The first part of our presentation focused on the 67% number. We shown the
bank that 67% of the users (which is a huge number) were constantly rejected in the flow.
But this number alone does not have much flavor. As long as they are maximizing their profit,
the bank does not care if they say "no" to 60%, 70%, 80% of the users or whatever.

That is why in the second part, we did some more basic math to estimate the potential
gains they were losing by not selling to this 67% of users.

# The new strategy

A quick recap. Each individual user that entered inside our sales path, wants to
get a loan. But, this user needed to be elegible to three different types of
loan to actually acquire the loan he wanted through our channel.

But, what if we change the sales path, so that:

- An user does not need to be elegible to all three modalities to acquire a loan;
- If an user is elegible to modality A, then, we should offer a loan of modality A to him;
- If is elegible to modality A and B, then, we offer both loans of modality A and B;
- If is elegible to modality A, B, and C, then, we offer all three types of loans (A, B and C);

We estimated that, if we changed the sales path so that it would fit the descriptions above,
then, we would increase the users coverage to 96.8%! This means that we could sell a loan to
96.8% of the users that entered our sales path, instead of only 33%.

If you are thinking that 33% + 67% should be equal to 100% instead,
you are forgetting that the user needs to fit into other criterias that I did not mentioned here.
In other words, even if we included the 67%, 96.8 - 100 = 3.2% of users would still be
rejected because they did not fit into other necessary criterias.

Doing some basic rule of three, this could mean a potential sales increase of 193%!
On the first month after we implemented this new strategy on production,
the sales increased approximately 142%, and on the second month, 400%.
The sales of this specific loan have a strong seasonal component to it, that is why you
have such a big variation from 142% to 400%. But nevertheless, this
demonstrates the positive impact of our strategy.


## Estimates are better than you think

A data analyst should not rely solely on hard numbers to defend they hypothesis.

# Collecting the users metadata with R

To identify which users did and did not had the
black credit card, we needed the data returned by the API.
But we had to effectively collect this data. In other words,
this data was not readily and easily available to us.

We had to ask to the API for the metadata of each individual user.
So in essence, we just collected the data returned by the API for each
individual user, then, we organized this data into a concise and structured
form, then, we store it, and then, we analyze it.

To do that, we first collected the social IDs of all the users that
entered in our flow over the last month, and we stored inside a CSV file.
Then, we just imported this CSV file to R, like this:

```{r}
#| eval: false
library(readr)
social_ids <- read_csv("social-ids.csv")
```

After that, we just created
