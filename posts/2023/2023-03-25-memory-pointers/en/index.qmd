# Introduction

A memory pointer in C and C++ is just a variable that stores a memory adress. Is that it. If you have a variable in your C or C++ program that stores a memory adress, than, this variable is a memory pointer. As you can imagine, this stored adress corresponds to a point in the memory of your computer.

So, an **memory adress is a location in the memory of your computer**. In contrast, a **memory pointer is a variable that stores a memory adress**.
