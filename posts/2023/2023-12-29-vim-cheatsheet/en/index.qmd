NeoVim is a highly extensible and "keyboard-based" text editor. Many consider NeoVim as an evolution of the famous
Vim text editor, with focus on extensibility.

What really makes NeoVim (and also Vim) an extremely powerful editor are the Vim commands and keyboards shortcuts.
To make my life easier, I decided to write a quick cheatsheet that contains all of the Vim commands
and keyboard shortcuts that I use the most.
