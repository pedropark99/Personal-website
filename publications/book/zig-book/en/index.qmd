# About the book

This is an open book that provides an introduction to the [Zig programming language](https://ziglang.org/),
which is a new general-purpose, and low-level programming language for building robust and optimal software.

{{< include ../buttons-en.html >}}

This book is designed for both beginners and experienced developers. It explores the exciting world of Zig
through small and simple projects (in a similar style to the famous "Python Crash Course" book from Eric Matthes).
Some of these projects are: a Base64 encoder/decoder, a HTTP Server and an image filter.

As you work through the book, you will learn:

- The syntax of the language, and how it compares to C, C++ and Rust.
- Data structures, memory allocators, filesystem and I/O.
- Optionals as a new paradigm to handle nullability.
- How to test and debug a Zig application.
- Errors as values, and how to handle them.
- How to build C and Zig code with the build system that is embedded into the language.
- Zig interoperability with C.
- Parallelism with threads and SIMD.
- And more.
