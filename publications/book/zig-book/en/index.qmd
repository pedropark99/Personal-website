# About the book

This is an open book that provides an introduction to the [Zig programming language](https://ziglang.org/),
which is a new general-purpose, and low-level language for building robust and optimal software.

{{< include ../buttons-en.html >}}

This an open book, meaning that, it is open-source, and it will always be open for anyone that wants to read it.
However, this book is still under construction ðŸš§ and active development, so,
it's contents might change drastically in the near future.

Also, this is a project-based book, which means that we learn how to use the
Zig programming language through small and simple projects, in a similar style to the
famous "Python Crash Course" book from Eric Matthes.
