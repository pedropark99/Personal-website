This book is still under active construction and development! This means that not all chapters are ready yet, and the current contents might change in the close future. However, you can already read some of its parts by [visiting its website](https://pedropark99.github.io/Introd-pyspark/).

:::: {class="about-this-book-text"}
Although we have a good range of materials about Apache Spark in general, such as @damji2020 and @chambers2018, we do not have much abundance of materials about the APIs of Spark in "foreign" languages, like the Python (`pyspark`) and R (`SparkR`) APIs. 

The reason for this is simple: the Spark API have a consistent structure across all languages. As consequence, a general book about Spark can fairly cover all languages at once. In other words, Spark code in Scala can be easily translated into python code with `pyspark`. Because the structure of the code is very similar between all languages.

So why this book? First, python is a more popular and friendly language than Scala or Java. If the reader is not interested in learning Java or Scala, why show Java/Scala? Is very important to focus solely on what interest the reader, specially if it is in a language that he is familiar with. Second, I had some time to spent, and, a lot of practical experience with `pyspark` on production to share (so... why not to write a book about it?).

This book aims to give a solid introduction to python (and not python) users to the `pyspark` package, and how to use it to build Spark applications for data analysis.
