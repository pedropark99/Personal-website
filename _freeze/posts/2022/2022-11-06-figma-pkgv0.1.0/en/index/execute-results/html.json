This package provides a R interface (or a web client/wrapper) to the [Figma API](https://www.figma.com/developers/api). Below we have all the important links about this package:\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/pedropark99/figma\"> <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-primary\">Official repository</button></a>\n<a href=\"https://pedropark99.github.io/figma/\"> <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-primary\">Package website</button></a>\n<a href=\"https://cran.r-project.org/package=figma\"> <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-primary\">Page on CRAN</button></a>\n\n\n\nThis is the first release (or the first version) of the package, and for now, it have all the necessary functionality to get all data from a Figma file, and bring it to your R session. But in the future, the package will include more functionalities and endpoints. Please, if you can, test this package and give feedbacks or report bugs by [sending Issues on the official repository](https://github.com/pedropark99/figma/issues).\n\n\n## Getting started\n\nFist of all, you need to install the package on your machine, and to do that, you can use this code:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ninstall.packages(\"figma\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nOr, to install the development version directly from GitHub:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ndevtools::install_github(\"pedropark99/figma\")\n```\n:::\n\n\n\nNow, to get the data of a Figma file through the Figma API, you have to collect two key variables about your file and your credentials. \nThey are:\n\n- `file_key`: The ID (or the \"key\") that identifies your Figma file;\n- `token`: Your personal access token from the Figma platform;\n\nTo use specifically the `figma::get_figma_page()` function, you will need to collect a third information, which is the `node_id`, or the ID that identifies a canvas/page of your Figma file. I explain, in details, on how to collect these key variables on the [main vignette package](https://pedropark99.github.io/figma/articles/figma.html). For brevity reasons, lets assume in this blog post that you already have collected these variables.\n\n\n## Use `get_figma_file()` to get your Figma file \nNow that you have the key (or ID) that identifies your Figma file, and your personal token that\nidentifies yourself, you can use `figma::get_figma_file()` to get your Figma file:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(figma)\nfile_key <- \"hch8YlkIrYbU3raDzjPvCz\"\n# Insert your personal token:\ntoken <- \"Your personal token ...\"\n\n# Returns a `httr::response` object:\nfigma_file <- figma::get_figma_file(\n  file_key, token\n)\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe functions from `figma` package returns a `httr::response` object by default. But you can use the `.output_format` argument to fit the data into a more intuitive data strucuture. For example, a `tibble::tibble` object:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\n# Returns a `tibble::tibble` object:\nfigma_file <- figma::get_figma_file(\n  file_key, token,\n  .output_format = \"tibble\"\n)\n\nprint(figma_file)\n```\n:::\n\n\n```\n#> # A tibble: 5 Ã— 7\n#>   canvas_id canvas_name canvas_type object_id object_name   objecâ€¦Â¹ object_attâ€¦Â²\n#>   <chr>     <chr>       <chr>       <chr>     <chr>         <chr>   <list>      \n#> 1 0:1       Page 1      CANVAS      1:2       Background    RECTANâ€¦ <named list>\n#> 2 0:1       Page 1      CANVAS      5:2       Paragraph     TEXT    <named list>\n#> 3 0:1       Page 1      CANVAS      5:3       Arrow         VECTOR  <named list>\n#> 4 5:4       Page 2      CANVAS      5:5       BackgroundPaâ€¦ RECTANâ€¦ <named list>\n#> 5 5:4       Page 2      CANVAS      5:6       Texto da pÃ¡gâ€¦ TEXT    <named list>\n#> # â€¦ with abbreviated variable names Â¹â€‹object_type, Â²â€‹object_attributes\n```\n\nEach row in the above `data.frame` is an object drawn in a canvas/page in your Figma file. Every object that you drawn in the canvas of your Figma file, can have a different type (like RECTANGLE, CIRCLE, TEXT, etc.). And objects of different types usually have different attributes. \n\nFor example, TEXT objects have a `characters` attribute, which have the exact text that is written in the text box. In the other hand, RECTANGLE objects does not have such attribute.\n\nAll the attributes of each object are in the `â€‹object_attributes` column, which is a `<list>` column. Each row (or, if you prefer, each element) in this column is a list with all the attributes of the object described in the corresponding row. For example, to collect the `characters` attribute of the first TEXT object described in `figma_file` (which is in the 2nd row), you could do this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nfigma_file$object_attributes[[2]][[\"characters\"]]\n```\n:::\n\n\n```\n[1] \"Um texto qualquer, que nÃ£o sei se vai dar certo\"\n```\n\nOr, you could the functions from `dplyr` and `purrr` packages to extract the `characters` attribute from all TEXT objects of your Figma file, like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntext_objects <- figma_file |> \n  dplyr::filter(object_type == 'TEXT') \n\ntext_objects[['object_attributes']] |> \n  purrr::map_chr('characters')\n```\n:::\n\n\n```\n[1] \"Um texto qualquer, que nÃ£o sei se vai dar certo\" \"Texto da pÃ¡gina 2\"\n```\n\n# Other scopes of data\n\nThe `figma::get_figma_file()` get the data of all objects drawn in all canvas/pages of a Figma file. But, maybe, you don't need all data from your file. Maybe you just need the data from a section, or a specific part of your Figma file.\n\nFor these occasions, the `figma` package offers the `figma::get_figma_page()` (get data of objects drawn in a specific canvas/page of your file) and `figma::get_document_info()` (get metadata about your Figma file) functions. \n\nThese functions work basically the same way as `figma::get_figma_file()`, they have the same arguments (except `figma::get_figma_page()` which have a extra argument `node_id`). Check the [documentation of these functions](https://pedropark99.github.io/figma/reference/index.html), and the [main vignette of the package](https://pedropark99.github.io/figma/articles/figma.html) to see examples.\n\n",
