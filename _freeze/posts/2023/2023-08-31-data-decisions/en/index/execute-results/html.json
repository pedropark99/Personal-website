Special thanks to\n[Guilherme Goes](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guilhermeggarcia/) and [Paulo Gon√ßalves](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paulo-gon-oli/). They both help me to present these ideas and insights to our client.\n\n**Making decisions is hard**. But you always make a better decision when you have data\nto guide you into a safer and better outcome. When you do not have data to back you up,\nyou are basically in the dark. That is, you make the decision, but you do not know\nupfront what are the possible outcomes of that decision. You just hope for the best,\nand this is always a hard position to be in.\n\n\n## A Data Analyst should focus on understanding the business\n\nYou will probably notice that a big part of this article is dedicated\nto give context and explain the business behind this example.\n\nThis is intentional, because, one of the real values of this article is\nto show that we come up with a good proposal to our client, because we\nunderstood his business, and we raised some good hypothesis about this business,\nand by analyzing these hypothesis we come up with a good new strategy.\n\nIf you do not understand the business you are analyzing, is less\nlikely that you will come up with a good strategy, or, a good\ndata analysis. By having a good understanding of the business,\nyou will likely have much better ideas on \"how\" to analyze the data you have.\n\n\n# Context\n\nIn essence, our client was a big brazilian bank, one of the largest in the market.\nThe bank was using our digital plataform to sell different products and services through\n[WhatsApp](https://www.whatsapp.com/). Our job was to analyze the data generated by the\nplatform to understand how the bank could increase their sales inside this channel.\n\n## The secured loan product\n\nA secured loan was one of several products offered by the bank on WhatsApp.\nTo acquire this product, the user needed to answer several questions, and also,\nfit into some criterias.\n\nDepending on the type of industry you work in, you might call this as the *sales flow*,\nor, the *sales path*, which is the path (or the steps) that the user needs\nto follow to acquire the product you are selling.\n\nMost companies want to make this path as short as possible so that the user\ngets to the product faster. However, we are talking about a loan,\nso the bank certainly needs a lot of personal and financial information about the user\nbefore it gives the loan.\n\nSo in this example, the user needed to answer a considerable amount\nof questions through WhatsApp to get to the final step of the sales path, that is,\nto confirm the loan.\n\nMost of these questions were asking for some personal information, specially the social ID.\nWith the social ID at hand, we used some APIs to check whether this particular user\nfitted or not into some important criterias. Most of these criterias\nwere very standard for any type of loan, like... the person should not have any legal debts\nwith the government.\nSome other criterias were purelly financial and assets related,\nand were also a very commom practice among banks, like...\nthe person needs to be fully employed, he/she needs to have a car which is\nfully paid, and, this car needs to be a personal property of the person, i.e. it cannot be \na borrowed car from another person.\n\n\n\n## The weird criteria\n\nBut one of the many criterias was a bit strange for us. Identify the exact criteria is not important for the content of this article. Let's just say that, to be elegible for this loan, **the user needed to be elegible to three different modalities**.\n\nEach modality corresponded to a different type of loan.\nIf the user was not elegible to all of these three modalities,\nwe automatically rejected the user's request for the loan.\n\nIn essence, we had a flow that worked a bit like this:\n\n![A small representation of the sales path](./../flow-extended.png)\n\nEvery time a user entered our flow, we collected the social ID of this user.\nBecause with this social ID we can use the API to check multiple informations\nabout this person. One of the many things we checked, was whether or not\nthis user was elegible to these three modalities.\n\n## Why this was weird?\n\nThis was a weird criteria, because... if a user called \"Ana\" is elegible to modality A,\nthen, why not offer a loan of modality A to \"Ana\" ? If a user \"Mike\" is elegible\nboth to modalities A and B, then, we should offer both modalities (A and B) to him.\nLet him get whatever loan he wants, right?\n\nWhy only users that are elegible to all\nthree modalities (A, B and C) get to decide which loan they want to get?\nIn our head, this criteria did not made much sense, because if an user\nis elegible to one modality of loan, he should be able to get\na loan on this modality he is elegible to.\n\n\n## Why this criteria existed?\n\nThis criteria existed either because a MVP strategy or a \"risk trade-off\" strategy.\nThe MVP strategy means that the bank included this weird criteria because it\ngreatly simplified the development of the sales path. By simplifying the\ndevelopment, the bank could deliver a MVP (minimal viable product)\nas fast as possible.\n\nOn the other side, the \"risk trade-off\" means that\nthe bank included this weird criteria, because it probably estimated\nthat the risk is considerably higher for people that are not\nelegible to all three modalities. If the estimated risk is higher, then,\nthe bank have a good reason to not offer this loan to people\nthat are elegible to only one or two modalities.\n\nBanks are constantly facing a trade-off between risk and profit. In\nother words, a secured loan like this is always a good profit opportunity.\nHowever, this profit opportunity always come at a cost, mostly in the form of risk.\n\nThat is why banks are usually very good at analysing and estimating risks. When a person\nlooks to acquire a loan, the bank starts to analyze several factors\nin order to estimate how much risky is to give a loan to this person.\n\n\n\n# What we discovered\n\nWe had the hypothesis that this business rule (about the three modalities)\nwas severely affecting the sales result. But we needed to confirm this hypothesis.\n\nSince we had the data returned from the API, we could potentially identify\nwhich users did have the three modalities, and which did not have. So we used R to collect the data\nfrom the API, and to analyze this data to investigate the users metadata,\nand potentially measure the size of the hole\nthat these users were creating.\n\nAs a result, we discovered that the bank was constantly losing a huge opportunity because of this\nspecific criteria, or, this specific business rule.\nDoing some basic math, we identified that\n**67% of the users that visited our channel were not elegible to all three modalities**.\nThis means that 67% of the users that entered our channel were automatically rejected.\nWe were constantly losing a huge chunk of potential leads\nbecause they did not fitted into this criteria.\n\nSo, for example, if 13,000 users entered our channel, only $(1 - 0.67) \\times 13,000 = 4,290$\nof these users could potentially finish the path and acquire the loan. The\nremaining 8,710 users were automatically lost. They were just rejected\nbecause they did not had these three modalities.\n\nThis discovery generated some important possibilities for us:\n\n- Are we reaching the right audience?\n- Maybe we should focus in attract only people that do have the three modalities to our channel? \n- Is this criteria or business-rule worth it?\n\n\n\n\n## Using data to get a better outcome\n\nOur job was to use the data we collected, to show the bank that the potential gains of\nselling different types of loans to these users that did not had the three modalities,\nwere much higher than the potential risk they offered. By using data, we can show the bank (in\nnumbers) the size of the opportunity they were losing. And that is exactly what we did.\n\nOur argument was divided into two separate parts:\n\n1. The size of the lost;\n1. The size of the potential gain;\n\nThe first part of our presentation focused on the 67% number. We shown the\nbank that 67% of the users (which is a huge number) were constantly rejected in the flow.\nBut this number alone does not have much flavor. As long as they are maximizing their profit,\nthe bank does not care if they say \"no\" to 60%, 80% of the users or whatever.\n\nThat is why in the second part, we did some more basic math to estimate the potential\ngains they were losing by not selling to this 67% of users.\n\n\n## Estimates are better than you think\n\nA data analyst should not realy solely on hard numbers to defend they hypothesis.\n\n<!--\n# Collecting the users metadata with R\n\nTo identify which users did and did not had the\nblack credit card, we needed the data returned by the API.\nBut we had to effectively collect this data. In other words,\nthis data was not readily and easily available to us.\n\nWe had to ask to the API for the metadata of each individual user.\nSo in essence, we just collected the data returned by the API for each\nindividual user, then, we organized this data into a concise and structured\nform, then, we store it, and then, we analyze it.\n\nTo do that, we first collected the social IDs of all the users that\nentered in our flow over the last month, and we stored inside a CSV file.\nThen, we just imported this CSV file to R, like this:\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(readr)\nsocial_ids <- read_csv(\"social-ids.csv\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nAfter that, we just created \n-->",
