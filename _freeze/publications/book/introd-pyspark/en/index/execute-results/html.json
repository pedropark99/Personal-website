This means that not all chapters are ready yet, and the current contents might change in the close future. However, you can already read some of its parts by [visiting its website](https://pedropark99.github.io/Introd-pyspark/).\n\n# About the book\n\n<a href=\"https://github.com/pedropark99/Introd-pyspark\"> <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-primary\">Official repository</button></a>\n<a href=\"https://pedropark99.github.io/Introd-pyspark/\"> <button type=\"button\" class=\"btn btn-primary\">Read online</button></a>\n\n\n\n::: {style=\"float:left;display:flex;justify-content:space-between;padding:30px\"}\n\n:::: {class=\"about-this-book-text\"}\n\nIn summary, this book aims to give a solid introduction (for python and not python users) to the `pyspark` package, and on how to use it to build Spark applications for data pipelines and interactive data analysis.\n\nAlthough we have a good range of materials about Apache Spark in general, such as @damji2020 and @chambers2018, we do not have much abundance of materials about the APIs of Spark in \"foreign\" languages, like the Python (`pyspark`) and R (`SparkR`) APIs. \n\nThe reason for this is simple: the Spark API have a consistent structure across all languages. As consequence, a general book about Spark can fairly cover all languages at once. In other words, Spark code in Scala can be easily translated into python code with `pyspark`. Because the structure of the code is very similar between all languages.\n\nSo why this book? First, python is a more popular and friendly language than Scala or Java. If the reader is not interested in learning Java or Scala, why show Java/Scala code to him? Is very important to focus solely on what interest the reader, specially if it is in a language that he is familiar with. Second, I had some time to spent, and a lot of practical experience with `pyspark` on production to share (so... why not write a book about it?).\n::::\n\n\n\n::: {.cell layout-align=\"center\"}\n::: {.cell-output-display}\n![](../featured.png){fig-align='center' width=100%}\n:::\n:::\n\n\n:::\n\n\n\n\n",
